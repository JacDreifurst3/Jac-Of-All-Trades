How to use the docker files:
A docker file downloads all dependencies for you, so technically you need nothing downloaded. It also ensures that it runs smoothly between Mac, Linux, and Windows. 

TO RUN DOCKER FILE: Download Docker Desktop on your computer.
If you have a Mac M1-4 chip download the sillicon version. Once you have downloaded your docker and logged in open the desktop app. 

Next go to vs code and in the command line of the project
run the command : docker compose up --build

This will run the program, make sure that no errors happen. 
When you are done with the code run the command : docker compose down.
